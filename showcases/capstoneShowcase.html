                <p id="gameDescription">
                    Treachery At Murder Manor is a COOP game where you are invited to a diner party in a big mansion. Once you arrive you discover that the host
                    has been murdered! One of the guests is the murder and is chasing the rest of the innocent guests. The innocent guests are looking for clues 
                    to solve the murder and call the police to stop the murder!
                </p>

                <p id="myRole">
                    My role in developing the game was creating the UI design. It went through many iterations but we finally decided on a minimalistic
                    UI that gave you all the information with out cluttering the screen
